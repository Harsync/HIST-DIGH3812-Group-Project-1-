Theme:
- How videogames can represent historical events and artfects through their depiction of war.

Process:
- First part of the process was creating a twitterbot bot to serve as the basis for our account.
- Next part was creating a theme or focus for the repository, we decided to focus on the history of war.
- The remix factor of the project will be how videogames have come to recreate history war settings, soldiers and artefacts. 
- the next step is finding the proper content to include in our museum, we decided on vehicles, uniforms and artefacts from the war.
- Creating a theme was a big part of trying to reflect the theme of a museum in the repository. 
- After creating a repository, all members were added as collarborators to post their content.
